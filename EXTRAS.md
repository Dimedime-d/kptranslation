Hi! I hope you're having fun playing _Kururin Paradise_. This document contains some extra features not mentioned in the base game.

These features were probably tucked away in a handful of strategy guides nearly 2 decades ago, but now I'm making them public information. There's nothing _achievement_-worthy here, just a couple of neat features worth mentioning.
