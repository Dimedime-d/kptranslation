Raw binary files representing graphical text used by the game. Mostly contains GBA 4bpp graphics, relative offsets, and binaries used to construct objects consisting of multiple blocks.

```.bin``` files are no different from ```.dmp``` files (they both contain raw data), with the my general convention that ```.dmp``` files were generated on their own using the files in this repo. ```.bin``` files came from elsewhere or were hand-edited by me.
